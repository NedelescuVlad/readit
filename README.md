# Welcome to readit
This is a UI-less and much-simplified version of reddit, where Rails beginners can learn the basics of models and associations.

## Setup
Clone this repository in your folder of choice and cd into it:<br/>
`git clone https://github.com/NedelescuVlad/readit`<br/>
`cd readit`

Install the required gems:<br/>
`bundle install` or simply `bundle`

Create the database schema and populate it with dummy data:<br/>
`rails db:setup`

At this point, you are ready to go.

## How to use
You can use readit to test the concepts that you read about in the rails guides. 

[A basic Rails models guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_model_basics.html)<br/>
[A basic Rails associations guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html)

Once ready, run the rails console with `rails c`. 

Query the database to your own liking.<br/>
Create your own objects and save them to the database.

#### Data Models 
1. User
2. Post
3. Comment

#### Associations 
1. Each post belongs to a user. 
2. Each comment belongs to a user and a post.
3. Each user (may) have many posts (or none).
4. Each user (may) have many comments (or none).
5. Each post (may) have many comments (or none).

#### Resetting the database
Run `rails db:reset` to delete all the objects you saved and start over.

## Running the tests
If you would like to run the test suite, a `bundle exec rspec` should do the trick.
